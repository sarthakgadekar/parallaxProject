# parallaxProject
Welcome to my web development project, where I have utilized HTML and CSS to create a stunning parallax effect on a website. Parallax scrolling is a technique that creates an illusion of depth on a website by making the foreground and background move at different speeds. By using this technique, I have created a dynamic and engaging user experience that will capture your attention and keep you scrolling. Throughout this project, I have applied my knowledge of HTML and CSS to design and develop a website that is not only visually appealing but also functional.
